**Instructions for use**

This program has 3 functions.  In order to select a function, pass either 1, 2, or 3 arguments when running the program.

__Function 1: List all stations in a line__
To invoke this function, pass 1 argument when starting the program.

Given a station number as a parameter, P1, the program will list all other stations belonging to the same line as the given station.  The stations will be listed in order, from one extremity of the line to another.

__Function 2: Shortest path between two stations__
To invoke this function, pass 2 arguments when starting the program.

Given two station numbers as parameters, P1 and P2, the program will return the quickest path between these two stations.

__Function 3: Shortest path between two stations when one line is closed__
To invoke this function, pass 3 arguments when starting the program.

Given three station numbers as parameters, P1, P2, and P3, the program will return the quickest path between stations P1 and P2, considering the fact that P3's line is entirely closed for maintenance.
